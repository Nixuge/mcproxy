# McProxy
A VERY Basic proxy to allow you to download Minecraft on networks where it's blocked

It can also allow you to proxy through other files if you eg want to download something from a cdn that's blocked, but in that case you need the secret_key from config.json as an argument

# Usage
See [mcdl.nixuge.me](https://mcdl.nixuge.me) (or templates/index.html)

# Todo
Cache invalidation, eg re download the index when a new version gets released.

Not sure if I'll ever add this, but if someone wants to use it I can.
